Big idea: Flipped learning has become "endemic" but we don't want it to lose its potency; we can keep it by 

How do we keep flipped learning potent? 
- Double down on "teaching oneself" 
- Using FL as a "pivot proof" framework (Equally effective, in fact not all that different, irrespective of modality)
- Double down on active learning and human connection 
- Personalize learning 


- Introduction
    - From pandemic to endemic 
    - Do viral ideas follow the same path? 
        - Example: Memes 
        - Example: Blogs 
    - Lifespan of a viral idea: 
        - Introduction on a very small scale
        - INitial uptake
        - At some point it makes a leap and is disruptive
        - Massive increase in uptake
        - Then it's everywhere, but the impact of a single instance drops to zero 
    - Wondering about flipped learning
        - Early impact -- Mazur, etc. and then Bergmann/Sams 
        - As uptake increased, potency did as well -- hugely disruptive 
        - Covid onset: Inflection point 
        - At this point lots and lots of people use some kind of flipped learning
        - But has it lost its potency? As I look around, it seems like it might be heading there, and it's just another classroom technique and not the transformative experience it could be. 
    - When viruses move from pandemic to endemic, that's generally good
    - When disruptive ideas in education do, that's not good
    - How do we keep FL from losing its potency? 
- 1: Lean in to self-teaching
    - "I had to teach myself" -- this is a feature not a bug
    - Unapologetically embrace self-teaching of basics -- in a guided way
    - Connects back to mission and vision statements -- a concrete enactment of these
- 2: Double down on active learning (even remote) 
    - Mini/micro version of Schoolcraft College here and the ecosystem framework 
- 3: Make it your administration's preferred paradigm
    - Disruptive to administrators 
    - Pivot proof 
    - Provides the personalized experience even when/especially when online 
    - Shows we're serious about all the things we say we are serious about
    - Things your admin can say if we embrace FL 
    - Getting admin to think about pedagogy is perhaps the biggest disruption of all
