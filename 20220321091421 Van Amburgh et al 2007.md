## Skim-through notes 

- Done for pharmacy – does that affect validity? 
- What is a "Didaktik triangle"
- In the discussion, there is a mention that they foresee the ALIT being used outside professional programs (health, science, and humanities)
- Also it was designed for large classes (100+) – does it work as well with smaller ones
