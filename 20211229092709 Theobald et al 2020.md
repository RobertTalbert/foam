## Notes

+ Introduction
  + Biggest cause of underrepresentation in STEM is attrition
  + It happens because students in those groups experience "achievement gaps" -- exam scores that are lower than peers in overrepresented groups plus failure rates that are higher 
  + Most efforts to mitigate achievement gaps have come _outside_ the course itself --- totally agree, so much focus on DEI programs that do not address the underlying issues of pedagogy 
  + For example supplemental instruction/tutoring -- these are successful but the studies don't control for self-selection bias (volunteers are more highly motivated) 
  + Student support over their entire career -- helpful and effective but expensive 
  + Also psychological interventions -- but these don't prove very helpful it turns out 
  + Researchers performed "individual participant data" meta-analysis 
  + "Although styles of lecturing vary, all are instructor-focused and grounded in a theory of learning that posits direct transmission of information from an expert to a novice. Active learning, in contrast, is grounded in constructivist theory, which holds that humans learn by actively using new information and experiences to modify their existing models of how the world works" --- good for explaining what active learning is 
  + Data analysis combined URM and low-income students 
  + 9328 individual student records from 51 classroom in 15 separate studies with data on exams; 44406 individual student records from 174 classrooms in 26 studies on course pass rates
  + "IPD metaanalyses, based on datasets like ours, are considered the most reliable approach to synthesizing evidence"


MGS = Minoritized group in STEM
URM = Underrepresented minority 

## Results

+ Achievement gap between MGS and non-MGS students for exams
  + -0.62 SDs for traditional lecturing
  + -0.48 SDs for active learning 
  + 33% reduction 
  + That's a SS difference -- still a gap, but less of one and we can attribute the difference to the pedagogy
+ Achievement gap between MGS and non-MGS students for pass rates
  + 7.1% lower for MGS students in passive learning
  + 3.9% lower for MGS students in active learning
  + 45% reduction 
  + Again, SS. Still a gap but significantly lower. 
+ Extensive variation among studies -- some studies actually show more gains for non-MGS students than MGS; others show gains for MGS but less prominent 
+ "For both examination scores and passing rates, *the amount of active learning that students do* is positively correlated with narrower achieve-ment gaps: Only classes that implement high-intensity active learning narrow achievement gaps between students from MGS and non-MGS"
  + Intensity = reported percentage of class time that student spend engaged with AL
  + Exam scores: difference of -0.48 MGS vs non-MGS for low-intensity active learning; -0.36 for high intensity 
    + 22% and 42% reductions over no active learning at all
  + Makes me wonder if active learning spaces have something to do with this -- is high intensity more likely to happen/easier to implement in an ALC? I think so. 
  + Passing rates: difference of -9.6% for low intensity vs. -2.0% for high intensity (16% and 76% reductions)
+ Other moderator analyses indicated that class size, course level, and discipline—for fields represented by more than one study in our dataset—did not explain a significant amount of variation in how achievement gaps changed

## Discussion

+ Active learning more likely to help MGS with passing than with exam scores (good news for those using mastery grading) 
+ AL is "not a silver bullet" -- "change will be most beneficial if faculty and administrators be-lieve that underrepresented students are capable of being successful (44) and make a strong commitment to quality in teaching." 
  + So it's much more a function of faculty/admin mindset about students. Faculty had a lot further to go than students. 
+ "we define teaching quality as fidelity to evidence-based improvements in course design and implementation" -- BOOM
+ Faculty just getting started with AL should start small and commit to persist -- may not see big improvements in the short term but they will come in the long term -- faculty need support/air cover on this from admin 
+ Two key elements: 
  + Deliberate practice
    + Extensive and highly focused efforts geared toward improving performance 
    + Scaffolded exercises 
    + Immediate feedback
    + Repetition 
  + Culture of inclusion 
    + Treating students with dignity and respect 
    + Communicating confidence in ability to meet high standards
    + Demonstrating genuine interest in students intellectual growth and personal growth/success
