## Notes

+ Introduction
  + Biggest cause of underrepresentation in STEM is attrition
  + It happens because students in those groups experience "achievement gaps" -- exam scores that are lower than peers in overrepresented groups plus failure rates that are higher 
  + Most efforts to mitigate achievement gaps have come _outside_ the course itself --- totally agree, so much focus on DEI programs that do not address the underlying issues of pedagogy
