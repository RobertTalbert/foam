>Heijstra, T. M., & Sigurðardóttir, M. S. (2018). The flipped classroom: Does viewing the recordings matter?. Active Learning in Higher Education, 19(3), 211-223.

## Questions and focus

- What is the video-watching behavior of students in a FL environment?
- What recordings seem to matter the most? 
- How can insights from these behaviors be used to help students attain a greater level of control in their learning process? 


## Method

- Background/subjects
    - Graduate research methods course in Iceland
    - 120 students 
    - 24% men, 76% women
    - Ages 23-58 years, average 34 and mode 26
- Course setup
    - Flipped
    - Online recordings and in class sessions
    - 12 course recordings – length ranged from 7 to 27 minutes 
        - Average 17.667 minutes, median 19 (seems kind of on the long side)
- Data collection
    - From Panopto – time/date of access; frequency of access; how long each student spent watching
    - "Phase 1": Online recording viewing behavior connection to four background variables
        - Gender
        - Age – lumped into < 30, 30 < x < 39, 40+
        - Course group (i.e. cohort within the class) 
        - Study prgram (Human Resources, Strategic Management, Marketing and Intl Business, other) 
        - Dependent variable = Viewing time (total amount of time spent watching the 12 recordings, in minutes)
    - "Phase 2": Relationships among the background variables and students' final course grades + relationship between viewing time and final course grade


## Results 

- Mean viewing time = 187 minutes (212 minutes total)
    - SD = 104 minutes (!) and range of 470 (so some students did nothing, others watched more than twice the available viewing time)
- % of students not watching the recordings increased as semester progressed

- Students who did watch:
    - 85% Did so in the week before or week of the class session
    - Except for week 4 and week 10 where only 64% and 45% watched during week before/week of the class session (so it was after?)
    - Later on the watching was more spread out, more strategic – watch the video only when working on the project and it's needed 
- Male students watched 145 minutes, female students 200 minutes (SS) 
- Course group and study program had no significant effect 
- Age and viewing time: 
    - <30 – 145 minutes
    - 30-40 – 188
    - 40+ – 243


- Phase 2
    - No SS effect of gender, age, group, study area on grade 
    - Significant (p < .05) effect of viewing time on grade
        - For every additional minute that students spent watching recordings, final grade increased by 0.002 points 
        - I'm unsure how those grades are calculated
        - viewing time explains 6.6% of variability within final grades 
    - Spending time watching recordings on core conceptual aspect of qualitative resarch related positively to grades; recordings on marginal topics not significantly related to grades 

## What it means

- Watching videos matters 
- But it kind of depends on what you're watching
- Tackle conceptual aspects early before dropout rates start to climb/fatigue sets in 



## Research possibilities

- Similar thing as this, but is there a difference in effect on grades when students view "core conceptual aspects" versus mechanical examples? Or examples done more "demo style"?
