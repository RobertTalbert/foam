## Questions/Focus 

+ Main question: How to design a mastery grading system that works for a large College Algebra course? 
    + Not only 100+ students but mostly taught by grad students and the course is taught by many different people
+ Previous uses of traditional grading: 
    + Final grade included HW points which skewed the meaning of the final grade
    + Learning objectives were "generally understood" but not clearly defined 
    + Final exam questions not clearly tied to learning outcomes 
+ SBG system – needs to be streamlined enough for ease of use by lecturers in 400+ student classes (!?) 


## Methods

+ Design of the system
    + Start with the rubric
        + Landed on 0-4 point rubric 
        + Measures not only correctness but also understanding 
    + Then come up with learning objectives – 34 in all https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3VZQaUdrW7eR09oVmxJX3JtcHVvOHhZUl9QalhBcEtJSDVz/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-9Lefs-7SnzxNUa0lS3jGrg 
        + Note that some, not all of the LO's have "...and justify your responses" in them; how are each of these awarded 0-4 points? 
    + Practice: 
        + Lesson notes and Explorations done in class 
        + Self assessments
        + Homework in WeBWorK and worksheet form
        + None of these convey any credit toward the course grade directly
    + Multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery
        + 8 25-minute quizzes over 2-4 LOs
        + Two unit exams
        + One final exams
        + So each student gets three shots at each LO. 
        + This feels *very* "one and done"-ish but it helps with the scaling up process I guess; not a fan of the timed testing but again, scaling up  
    + From the syllabus: The only thing that counts in the course grade is an average of scores on LO's. Some do; some are just "compute/find the following" – what kind of work on this would earn a 4 vs a 3? https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3VZQaUdrW7eaVpoa1A5NDhqQzNpYVZBeGc5bk14NTlTcjZR/view?usp=sharing&resourcekey=0-O4mpFNtjt1VqWXbcgdyFDg
+ It references Appendices several times but no appendices appear in the article; is this just stuff from Rachel's folder? 


## Findings

+ Compared section of college algebra done SBG vs. one done traditional (paper describes the somewhat complex pathways students have traveled to get there) 
+ Administrative effort
    + Lots of time needed to create support materials (they wrote their own OER book)
    + Time required to grade is about the same as traditional grading, but calculating course grades is simpler
    + Less time answering questions about grades 
    + Later: She says there's a lot of effort needed but it's front-loaded. 
+ Student behaviors 
    + More concept-focused questions from SBG students 
    + SBG students tended to come to office hours even when overall average was high 
    + Traditional students did more homework; SBG students did more self-assessments and Explorations
+ Focus group
    + Grades assess level of understanding, not just teacher giving a grade
    + Learning objectives gave feedback
    + Grade based on correctness and understanding seen as a positive 
    + Accountability 
+ Performance in subsequent classes
    + students went on either to trig or to one-semester survey of calculus
    + SBG students in trig: No drop in GPA; Trad students in trig: looks like a statistically significant drop 
    + In calculus: Both sets of students experienced a drop in GPA, but the SBG drop doesn't look significant while the traditional drop does 


## Discussion 

+ Interpretations: 
    + SBG provides a greater benefit for students who enter math sequence less prepared (See chart on grade changes downstream for "Dow" students vs. others) 
    + Also provides a greater benefit for students going into calculus than trig 
+ Reflections
    + Time  and effort required for developing support materials not just for students but also instructors 
    + Students need to be taught how to navigate support materials 
    + LMS has issues with SBG (they made a custom database) 
    + Final exam is individualized – they wrote a custom python script for this
