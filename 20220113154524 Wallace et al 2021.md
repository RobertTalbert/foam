# Wallace et al. 2021

>Wallace, C. S., Prather, E. E., Milsom, J. A., Johns, K., & Manne, S. (2020). Students taught by a first-time instructor using active learning teaching strategies outperform students taught by a highly-regarded traditional instructor._arXiv preprint arXiv:2004.09684_.

- Reforming an intro calculus-based physics course (258 in reform section, 217 in traditional)
- No statistical differences in populations other than a lower high school GPA in the reformed section
- Students in the traditional section had three 50-minute lectures each week, whereas students in the reformed section only had two 50-minute lectures each week. The reformed section gave up a full 50-minute lecture each week so that students could attend a weekly small-group (N ≈ 25) recitation section
- No “studio” or “SCALE-UP” style rooms were available for either section
- Rather than focusing class time on deriva-tions of equations, the reformed sec-tion’s lectures focused on developing students’ conceptual understandings, reasoning abilities, quantitative problem-solving skills, and fluencies with multiple-representations of the discipline.
    - THink pair share
    - And others (?) 
- During each class, students in the reformed section were presented with a problem and given a few minutes to attempt a solution while working in collaboration with their neighbors
    - Follow up with TPS actitivies based on polling questions – pose correct/incorrect mathematical formulations for problems 
- Exam performance mostly favorable to reform students – did better than traditional students

The punchline here is that the reform section used an inexperienced instructor whereas the traditional section used an experience award-winning lecturer. 

But this study seems to have a lot of confounding variables in it: there could be bias for age, bias for newness of the instructional method, there were only one section of each performed and traditional styles… In addition it seems like it's a pretty mild form of reform.there's still a lot of lecturing going on; there's only one section per week that was transferred to the recitation section…

So I see the results are more favorable for the reform students but I just don't think the design of the study and the statistical power of the results really say much.
