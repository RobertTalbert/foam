## Notes 

+ Intro/background
    + Basic question: Can you make an intervention for students who might need it, that's BRIEF, and likely to work based on predictive modeling where only a handful of learning events are needed? 
    + SRL involves three basic cyclical phases: 
        + Preparatory
        + Performance 
        + Appraisal
    + There are interventions in this area already but they either only have a small effect, or they are really long and involved. (And typically don't involve LA data or any kind of data.)
    + Questions: 
        + Do students who complete learning skills training outperform those predicted to perform poorly but who didn't do the training? (I.e. did the training work?) 
        + How do students who were *not* predicted to perform poorly, perform compared to those who were flagged (regardless of whether they received training)? (I.e. is the prediction valid?)
        + Among those flagged to perform poorly, do those who complete training do better gradewise than those who didn't complete the training? (i.e. did the intervention "work")
        + How does prediction and training influence proportion of students earning desirable and undesirable grades? (i.e. does the prediction and training "move the needle"?)
+ Method
    + 226 undergraduates in biology intro course 
    + 63% flagged as more likely to earn a C or worse based on...?
    + Of those flagged, ⅔ assigned to treatment condition
    + 79 flagged treatment students, 64 flagged control, 83 nonflagged 
    + Measures
        + Pretest – bunch of different problems including MC and algebra questions – no SS difference in pretesting between flagged treatment/flagged control
        + Exams – four unit tests and a final 
        + Learning events: Access of resources (and that's all?) 
        + Check-in activity 
            + Self report of study methods, feeling of preparation, grade expectations – this was done early
            + The treatment gropu had an additional module constituting the intervention
