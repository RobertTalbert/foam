# Notes for MTH 350 planning

## From David's 331 syllabus

- Office hours -- start with some, then add and adjust according to student feedback
- "Research notebook" 
- Class materials and announcements on Blackboard
- they have fixed groups 
- Class recordings? 

### Daily Prep and research notebook 

- Daily Prep: List current problems we're working on. Student's goal: To read and solve or make progress on these before next class. Put work in the research notebook 
  - What to do: Look up the reading and problems on Bb
    - Read text carefully for full understanding (this would be a place to instantiate definitions) 
    - For each problem: 
      - Start work on a new page in your notebook 
      - Work to solve the problem or write a proof 
      - Hang on to mistakes 
  - Work collaboratively 
  - Scan and upload work to Blackboard by 1pm of class day (meeting starts at 3, I'd need these earlier). Indicate in the comments box which problems you'd want to present (possibly for me, this includes a Google Form with basic exercises plus checkboxes for problems?)
  - What matters: Completion and effort 
- 

- Daily Prep is done outside of class. Due Monday and Wednesday.

### Homework and revisions

- 1-2 problems assigned each week -- significant assignments all proof based (I might change that up) 
- Always due Wednesday 11:59pm 
- Revise one problem per week 
  - Include reflection 




### Assessments

- Daily Prep twice a week
- Homework once a week
- Presentations and class journal 
- Check-ins (weeks 5 and 10) 
- Portfolio 

### Class journal

- Is a document where we collaboratively create professionally written solutions
- I list all problems open for class journal submissions
- Students claim these by email 
- I review the submission 
- I can ask students to be a reviewer 

### Portfolio 

- Is a way to make the case for the grade you think you've earned
- Narrative description of how the grade criteria are met + supporting evidence
