# HBR: "Go ahead and ask for more time on that deadline"

>Williams, A. (2021) Go ahead and ask for more time on that deadline. _Harvard Business Review_

- Main points: 
    - Just under half of important work deadlines were adjustable
    - Deadlines are often just "commitment devices"
    - But a series of studies of more than 4000 working adults reveals:
        - People are hesitant to request extensions out of concern that supervisors will judge them negatively for doing so. (Study of 900 people, when told that managers would know whether they requested a deadline extension on a writing aassignment they were 31% less likely to ask for one)
        - Second study with the tables turned – 1000 participants evaluating the writing samples of people from the first study. Were told whether or not the writer requested additional time. Those who did request additional time were rated higher quality, more competent, more motivated than those who did not
        - Third study: 200 managers, 200 full time employees asked to think about a situation with adjustable deadline at work – Employees overestimated the extent to which managers cared abou speed vs quality — so managers probably care less about this than the employees think
    - But...
        - prior research suggests that both asking for more time after a deadline has already passed, and asking for extensions over and over again, can lead to negative supervisor evaluations.
        - It depends on the deadline — another study, asking for extensions that are more costly can lead to negative consequences… but still. employees tend to overestimate extent to which asking for extensions here would lead to negative perceptions
- We tend to "optimize for metrics that are easily quantified" (completion time, did you/did you not finish by the deadline) as opposed to more qualitative metrics ("how good is the work") — this applies in a major way to #grading as a whole
- Time management skill is seen as a marker of overall competence (Comment from my students about being judged on time management skills) – even though the opposite is actually the case 
- Solution: **Clear communication**: Can deadlines be adjusted, formalize the criteria on which employees will be evaluated , when quality is more important
