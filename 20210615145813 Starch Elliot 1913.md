>Starch, D., & Elliott, E. C. (1913). Reliability of grading work in mathematics. The School Review, 21(4), 254-259.

## Questions and Focus 

1. How fine of a scale should we be using for grades? ("How fine of a scale of units is distinguishable")
2. What proportion of students will usually fall under each unit? 

+ Fineness of scale
    + For example, does it make sense to use a 0-100 scale for markings? Why not a 0.0-100.0 scale (go finer)? Is a scale with just four units too coarse? 
    + 

## Methods

### Fineness of scale

- Looked at two English papers from 142 teachers 
- Grades ranged from 64 to 98 on one paper, 50 to 98 on the other "probable error" of 4.0 and 4.8 respectively
- Also a paper in math, 118 teachers, grades range from 28 to 92 with probable error of 7.5
- Four main factors in the variation of these marks: 
    - Differences in standards among different schools
    - Differences among standards with different teachers
    - Differences in relative values placed by different teachers on different elements of the papers (i.e. differences in rubrics) 
    - Differences due to inability to disinguish between "closely allied degrees of merit" 

- [ ] What does "probable error" mean?
