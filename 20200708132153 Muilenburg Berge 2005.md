>Muilenburg, L. Y., & Berge, Z. L. (2005). Student barriers to online learning: A factor analytic study. _Distance education_, 26(1), 29-48. 

+ While evidence points to no actual significant differences in effectiveness of online learning between well-designed online courses and f2f, student perceptions differ and can have an effect on the effectivenes of a course. The course may be actually well-built and effective, but students might still perceive it as inferior and thus have a negative impact on the course's effectiveness. 
+ 11 different variables examined in terms of how they affect learning, attitudes, motivation.
+ Six factors isolated: 
    + Time/interruptions
    + Infrastructure/support services
    + Motivation
    + Prerequisite skills
    + Technical 
    + Social 
+ Biggest barrier to students was a lack of social interation – see [[20200707135907]] Martin et al 2019 since social presence was noted as the most important skill in effective online teaching – and there was a strong association between social interaction and enjoyment of the online course 
+ Second place: "administrative/instructor issues", time and support, learner motivation 
+ Technical issues were less commonly mentioned as barriers – this is probably an artifact of the sample, which appears not to be just students taking or who had recently taken online courses 
+ Students who predicted they "can't" learn well online had the highest degree of barriers – direct relationship betweeen students' perception that they can or cannot learn online and the severity of their barriers 
+ Students who had never taken online courses predicted higher barriers than those who had. Confirms a suspicion that students' stated lack of belief that online learning is effective is probably based on guesswork/prejudice rather than experience and once students have the experience, their feelings about it change.
