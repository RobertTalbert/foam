# What is the fruit that Christians bear? 

Today's Gospel reading was Matthew 13 – [http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/13:1](http://www.usccb.org/bible/matthew/13:1) 

From Fr. Bill's homily – The "fruit" here is love. The end purpose of all the seed-growing and all my efforts to stay on track is to love the right things, in the right ways.
