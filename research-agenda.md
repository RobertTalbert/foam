## Questions

- Does early training using traditional methods of evaluation lead to better performance on later evaluations that use traditional methods? 
  - Where this is coming from: An argument for traditional grading is that there are high-stakes points-based exams that students have to take eventually, like certification exams etc. And having preparation in college using traditional methods makes students better prepared for those. 
  - But does it? Seems questionable. 
  - So, experiment: Set subjects up to take some kind of high-stakes performanced based task. Randomly assign subjects to one of two preparatory groups -- one that gets feedback similar to that of the high-stakes task, another that has similar items on it but gets narrative feedback. Then give people the high-stakes task and see which group performs better.
