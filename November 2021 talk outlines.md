## CIS talk on mastery grading 

- My idea for a new programming language
  - It uses AI to know what you are *trying* to do when you program
  - Once you write the program, it evaluates how well your program works and then assigns you a score 
  - But then you are not allowed to ever work on it again. If your code doesn't work, that's too bad. 
  - This is the shittiest programming language ever if the purpose is to actually create functioning code that does what it's supposed to do. 
  - If I sat down and built a programming language specifically intended to make people not want to write computer code ever again, this is probably what I would build. 
- What does this have to do with grading? 
  - What is the purpose for grading student work?
  - Does grading do what we think it does? 
  - Is the purpose of grading, to get students to produce functioning solutions to problems? Or is it to audit their ability to produce such solutions under artificial conditions?
- How we grade now 
  - Student is given something to do 
- Problems with this 
  - Type I error
  - Type II error 
  - Motivation and demotivation 
  - It's not how people learn -- feedback loops (CS people know this better than anyone) 
- A different approach: Mastery grading
  - Four pillars 
- Mini case study from MTH 225 
  - Basic skills (Learning Targets)
  - Applications and Extensions (Weekly Challenges) 
  - Every item graded Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory
    - LT: Through quiz problems, oral quizzes. or student video. Satisfactory = basically no significant mistakes. 
    - Weekly Challenges: On rubric -- clear, complete, correct solutions that are written up professionally. 
    - No points. 
    - If not Satisfactory, retake again later or turn in a revision. 
    - Limits on revisions 
  - Course grade happens by meeting threshholds on these. 
- FAQs
  - Is it a ton of extra work? Not really. 
  - Do students like it? The standards are higher; students can't pass with 70% skill on everything. But they feel like things are focused on learning not grades. (Remarks from MIT) 

## HCC talk outline

"Maintaining the Personal Touch in a High-Tech Learning Environment"

- Start by trusting students
- Communicate
  - Leverage different media (not just text but also audio and video)
  - Multi-way communication (Slack, Campuswire) 
  - The way we communicate and the things we communicate (all pedagogical problems are actually communication problems)
- Connect
  - People to people
  - Ideas to ideas (mindmapping tools, etc.)
  - People to ideas (connects to creativity)
- Create 
  - Assessment that leverages creativity -- more authentic and less rote 
  - Leverage tech to allow learners to communicate their understanding in different ways (Flipgrid videos etc.)
