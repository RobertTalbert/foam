## Questions and focus

The author sets out to devise a grading system that

- Is based on frequent, low-stakes, short assessments (*using the concept of testing effect, and in an effort to reduce test anxiety*) 
- Favors formative assessments over summative ones (*test-enhanced learning*)
- Clearly articulates what students will be assessed on
- Affords students multiple opportunities to demonstrate mastery of those objectives
- Bases students’ final grade on their mastery of those objectives 

Last three points are aimed at mastery grading in general and in particular the development of a growth mindset. 

## Methods 

The result is something they call "Second Chance Grading"

1. Divide the course into 20 topics
2. Schedule 10 short quizzes in the semester each covering 2 topics
3. Schedule two second chance exams (that contain instances of all previous topics) – use max score (we're using points here) of the two attempts 
4. Schedule a second chance final exam — final exam has a comprehensive portion and an optional "second chance" portion
5. Compute final grade (80% of grade to quizzes, 20% to comprehensive part of final)

So this is kind of a simple implementation of mastery grading that hits the highlights of MG but doesn't stray that far from a traditional system.

**Support structures**: 

- Lesson notes: Weekly lesson outlines 
- Homework: Practice problems suggested but not required or graded 
- Quiz guidance email – agenda for quiz sent out before the quiz is given
- Notecard for use on the final exam 
- Discussions with students about strategies for quizzing (e.g. focusing only on new material, focusing only on retakes)

## Findings 

- 82 (59%) mentioned Second Chance Grading and 79 of the 82 (96%) had only positive things to say about the system. 
- 21 of the 51 (41%) mentioned that Second Chance Grading decreased their stress or anxiety about grades, learning, and mathematics
- 28 of the 51 (55%) mentioned that the system improved their learning
- Some students did not like this system because they were accustomed to having a lot more time for timed testing than just 20 minutes for the quizzes. 

*What about the other 59% and 45% in those last two points?* 

Impact on the instructor: 

- Shift in focus for office hours discussion away from performance and toward learning 
- Shift in feeling obligated to provide helpful feedback and not just take off points 

## Discussion/Questions

- Why use points at all on these quizzes? Why not just Pass/No Pass? What's the purpose of points and do they perhaps take away from students' focus on the feedback? 
- Any metacognitive mechanism for the second chance part? 
- Could measure the reduction in anxiety with an instrument
- The focus on timed quizzing seems to mitigate against higher-order skills. Author attempts to explain this as "If you want higher order skills, just include them in the quizzes" but I'm not convinced because quizzing may not be the best instrument for those. (So I could see a two-pronged approach with the second-chance quiz structure handling low level tasks and some other problem/project-based structure assessing higher level tasks.)
- My take: There are things I don't like about this system but for people wanting to get started, it seems like a nice incremental step that can be iterated later
