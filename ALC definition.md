What is an active learning classroom? 

An Active Learning Classroom (ALC) is a physical learning space that is optimized for the practice of active learning. While there is no official definition of what is an ALC, several common characteristics of ALCs emerge from research and practice: 

1. ALCs are *classrooms*, that is, formal spaces intended for learning in which learners co-locate to learn. We exclude virtual spaces as well as less-formal learning spaces such as faculty offices, library study spaces, and in-between spaces where students might work.  
2. ALCs allow for the *flexible rearrangement of the space* to facilitate traffic and information flow, and to make it easy for occupants to connect and communicate. Often, furniture is on wheels to allow for easy reconfiguration. This results in an *acentric* or *polycentric* design, i.e. there is no single fixed "front" or "back" of the room, and there is no specific area separating the instructor from the learners. 
3. ALCs typically provide *easy access to digital and analog tools for learning* such as projectors, whiteboards, computers, and paper and markers. In particular, electrical power is easily accessible to learners at any place in the ALC. 

ALCs *can* also include digital technologies for including remote learners in active learning activities, including camera and microphone arrays and high-quality digital projection. However, many ALCs do not include such technology. What makes an ALC what it is, is whether architectural design is intentionally done to optimize the use and effects of active learning.
