Hopkins, R. F., Lyle, K. B., Hieb, J. L., & Ralston, P. A. S. (2016). Spaced Retrieval Practice Increases College Students’ Short- and Long-Term Retention of Mathematics Knowledge. Educational Psychology Review, 28(4), 853–873. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-015-9349-8

## Main questions

- Can spaced retrieval practice help improve the classroom performance of engineering students, better than massed retrieval practice? 
    - _Massed_ RP: Doing retrieval practice in a short time window following acquisition
    - _Spaced_ RP: Doing RP in a more temporally distributed way 
- Does engaging in spaced retrieval practice make students better at massed retrieval practice?
