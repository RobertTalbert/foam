Hopkins, R. F., Lyle, K. B., Hieb, J. L., & Ralston, P. A. S. (2016). Spaced Retrieval Practice Increases College Students’ Short- and Long-Term Retention of Mathematics Knowledge. Educational Psychology Review, 28(4), 853–873. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10648-015-9349-8

## Main questions

- Can spaced retrieval practice help improve the classroom performance of engineering students, better than massed retrieval practice? 
    - _Massed_ RP: Doing retrieval practice in a short time window following acquisition
    - _Spaced_ RP: Doing RP in a more temporally distributed way 
- Does engaging in spaced retrieval practice make students better at massed retrieval practice?

## Method

- In the present study, we manipulated spaced versus massed retrieval practice in an Introductory Calculus for Engineers course. 
- via problem solving that required retrieval of "objective-critical information"
- Done on weekly basis 
- Massing or spacing of retrieval practice was implemented on weekly quizzes by varying the distribution of problems targeting particular learning objectives.
- Same instructor, assigned to different groups
- Not only students in this one course; some were followed into second-semester course 
- Measures: First unit exam in second semester course and third unit exam (third exam had no material from intro course); cumulative final 
- Equality of groups for racial composition, gender, ACT Math, GPA
- Intro course taught in a sort of emporium style 
- Learning objectives: 
    - 214 in all (!) 
    - distributed across 6 units 
    - 48 objectives selected as "targets" from units 1-4
    - Assessed by quizzes (2 per unit * 6 units)
    - Control: each quiz administered in the first four units of the course contained three questions covering each of six target objectives, all of which were introduced to students in the corresponding study plan
    - Experimental: Quizzes in the experimental group were identical to those in the control group except in the distribution of questions covering half (n=3) of the target objectives.

## Results

- Within subjects: Performance on spaced objectives significanatly better than performance on massed objectives 
- Between subjects: Performance on spaced objectives significanatly better than performance on massed objectives; and performance on massed objectives was higher in the experimental group than in the control group where *everything* was massed but the $p$ was 0.58, just short of significance 
- Differences on first unit exam did not approach significance – so as a baseline the two groups were similar 
- In the second semester course: 
    - Experimental > control on the first unit exam
    - But basically the same on third unit exam (no material from intro course)
    - And experimental > control on the final 

## Meaning

- First of all – retrieval practice helps; that's settled science and it should be a regular part of class activities 
- When doing RP, it helps to spread out the objectives – so always include a few stretch questions that reach further back than the most recent material 
- Example: My PI questions
- Example: Including review questions in pre-class and post-class work in a flipped class
