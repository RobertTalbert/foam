From _So Good They Can't Ignore You_ by Cal Newport

+ Newport talks about developing rare and valuable skills in order to earn autonomy, creativity, and impact.
+ This means adopting the "craftsman mindset" – figuring out what you can bring to the job rather than what the job can bring to you, and getting your head down and practicing your craft until you're very good at it. 
+ But what if you are a teacher? How does someone get good at teaching? Is there a metric I can use? The example in the book was a professional musician – a musician can tell they are getting better because they miss fewer notes, play progressively harder music, etc. and there's a built-in iteration under their control in the form of practice. 
+ But for teaching, what do you do? How can I tell if my teaching is getting any better, and what can I do to deliberately practice other than just teach one class at a time? Seems very slow, prohibitively so. 
+ So how does a professor build career capital? 
    + Maybe through deliberate design of courses and let others critique, and collect data from students 
    + Also through related work like blogging, service etc. (But then how does a department chair get better? A dean?)
