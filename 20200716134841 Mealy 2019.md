>Mealy, B. (2020). Best 2019 Zone IV Paper : Assessing Student Assessment in a Flipped Classroom Assessing Student Assessment in a Flipped Classroom.

Citation is wrong â€“ it's a paper from ASEE virtual conference 

+ _"This paper describes a novel implementation of an intermediate digital design course taught in a flipped-type classroom using a studio-type format. The overall goal of this approach was to determine the efficacy of dedicating a portion of class time to student assessment distributed throughout the course."_ Idea is that we waste the advantage of FL by spending so much class time on assessment, so what if we didn't? 
+ TRUE: "In order to properly support student learning, instructors must not only consider various modes of student learning for students, but also should consider the various real-life challenges that students typically face"
+ Study compares outcomes when students were given the option between frequent "distributed" assessments vs. clustered final exam grades. So doesn't directly apply to mastery grading, but the thing to focus on is the impact of choice and flexibility. 
+ Uh oh: "_Assessing students at the end of the course has several benefits. First, it provides the instructor more time to work directly with students. Using class time for assessment undermines some of the advantages of both the flipped classroom and the studio format. Second, it gives students more time to work with the subject matter before they are tested on it. Finally, writing only final exams frees the instructor from writing and grading exams and quizzes throughout the quarter, which is time that can be spent helping students_." 
    + In spirit I agree, but this is still an extremely high-stakes approach to assessment that doesn't allow students room to grow or improve, or even to know what they need improvement on!
