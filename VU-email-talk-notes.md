# Outline and Scripted bits for VU email talk

- Talking about email
  - I write a lot about email but I have never actually given a talk or workshop on this
  - Whenever I do write or tweet about email management, there's an eerie silence
  - I think nobody really wants to talk about it. In the sense that nobody wants to talk about religion or politics or anatomical functions -- it's a dirty subject that is tied to feelings of deep shame. 
  - But I think we do need to talk about it because...
- Every choice we make is a vote for the kind of person we want to be
  - Choosing not to engage with your email seems trivial but it has major effects 
  - You know how bad the burnout, overwork, overwhelm,and sometimes demoralization has been? Some of that is systemic, but some of it is personal and within our control. Some of the email practices we engage in are votes in favor of perpetual burnout. 
- Are you for real? What's so wrong about just letting my email go unchecked? 
  - Lots of problems - biggest one being the Zeigarnik effect
  - Uncompleted tasks are more memorable than completed ones
  - Each unprocessed email exerts a small but real downward force on your attention
  - Compounded over dozens... hundreds... thousands of unprocessed emails and it's like giving yourself dementia 
  - So the thing to do is not just read your email (do that) but *process* it --- clarify what each message is or means, then get it out of your inbox and into an appropriate place. 
- Doing so gets you to Inbox Zero...
  - When you have reached Inbox Zero then you have zero attention given to your inbox, either on purpose or otherwise --- you are free to be fully present with the people, problems, and tasks of life that deserve your attention. 
- MY PROCESS
  - I get to Inbox Zero at the end of each day -- and here is my process. I am going to not only show the process but demonstrate live, with my real inbox.  
  - First, you will need five lists and a calendar. I keep mine in Trello but this could be anything....
  - The Clarity Loop 
    - Use this flowchart to clarify each and every email in each inbox, so that things get out of the inbox and into the right place so that each actionable item can be acted upon at the right time and each non-actionable item is appropriately housed.
