+ They interviewed eight profs who had won awards from one of two third-party organizations for online education to learn about the roles and competencies for effective online teaching. 
+ The roles: 
    + **Facilitator**
    + **Course designer** – architectural stuff as well as "design thinking" e.g. iteration 
    + **Course manager** – nuts and bolts 
    + **Subject matter expert**
    + **Mentor** 
+ Online presence was cited as the most important facet of effective online teaching – boils down to giving students a feeling that you are "there". 
    + Make personal videos, especially for startup
    + Give timely and constructive feedback
    + Let students know you see them and the work they are doing 
    + Helping students manage time and attention GTD stuff 
+ Engagement also important – this means motivation I think, and focusing attention – authentic experiences 
+ Several noted "creat[ing] an effective and productive learning experience for the students" was the primary role – engaging students, keeping them motivated, providing structure, providing feedback, being responsive, giving detailed instructions
+ Tasks: 
    + Course design
    + Teaching
+ Competencies:
    + Technical skills – esp. screencasting and technical writing, visualization 
    + Willingness to learn – this is really interesting
        + People who aren't willing to learn and grow and to see themselves as online learners are unlikely to exhibit good online teaching
    + Knowledge of how people learn
    + Content expertise
    + Course design skills 
    + Ability to design good assessments and give feedback
+ Instructor roles shift as a course progresses. At first the prof is 100% course designer; then as the course starts the teaching role ramps up; later in the term the prof is more cheerleader. Or, all those roles are there but the coefficients change value throughout the term. 
+ Needing to maintain a growth/learning mindset throughout the experience is a key skill for online instruction – and it's probably a big reason why so many right now are going to be terrible online instructors. This is a blocker for many faculty, rather than an asset. 
+ Mentoring is also critical while the course is running – helping students build self-regulation skills, manage time and attention, work on their study skills and metacognition. And all that takes _presence_. 


## Questions

- What would the roles, etc. be if you focused on flipped learning courses rather than online/hybrid courses? There aren't any award-granting organizations for FL, but if there were and you could interview award-winning FL instructors, would you see roles etc. that are a subset of these? Or are they exactly the same?
