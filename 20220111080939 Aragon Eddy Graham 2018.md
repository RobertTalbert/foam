 ## Summary 
 
 - Intro
     - Instructors tend to agree with the benefits of active learning
     - But encounter lots of barriers
     - One of those is their own belief about the malleability of intelligence — fixed- versus growth mindset
     - "The underlying assumption in a fixed-mindset theory of intelligence is that only those who are capable will learn. **This assumption conflicts with active-learning innovations**."
     - "For the instructor who truly believes that only the “smartest” students will understand com-plex topics, it may seem fruitless to make large investments of time and resources for essentially equivalent outcomes, because “only the bright students will understand anyway.” "
     - _Hypothesis: Selection of teaching/learning activities is influenced by mindset held by individual faculty_
     - "Adoption of new teaching strategies by instructors can be con-ceptualized as a multistage process. The model of adoption developed by Aragón and Graham (2015) recognizes five stages: exposure, persuasion, identification, commitment, and implementation  (EPIC-implementation)."
         - Exposure: See the method in action or in theory
         - Persuasion: Be persuaded that it's a good idea (and*their* idea)
         - Identification: Consider whether or not change is a good thing *for you* (Identify personally with the teaching method) 
         - Commitment: Commit to implement the practice 
         - Implementation: Actually use the method in a real classroom 


**Side notes:**
- This feels realistic given the STRONG streak of autonomy among faculty
- This feels useful for the ALCs in Winter 2022 – we are aiming for "Identification" among non-users, and for others it's getting to the next phase 
- I wonder how this would work with studying ALCs 

## Methods summary 

The researchers contacted participants from a summer institute on scientific teaching over a 10-year period (2004-2014). The institute provided robust exposure to a variety of teaching practices. Of the 1179 past participants contacted, 620 responded and consented. They were given a survey with two particular parts: Part 1 presented seven active learning practices that were part of the institute, and checkboxes asking participants the extent to which they had considered or implemented each practice (corresponding to the five stages of the EPIC-Implementation model). Part 2 presented them with a three-question survey based on Carol Dweck's work, about beliefs regarding fixed vs. growth mindset re: intelligence. The results from Part 2 (Likert scale on a 1-6 scale) were combined into a single score -- high = fixed mindset and low = growth. On the other hand, the results from the teaching practices survey were tabulated to give the average number of active learning teaching practices attained at each level of EPIC-Implementation. Researchers then built a model to examine correlations between the averages from Part 1 and the mindset score from Part 2. 

*Questions coming up*: What sort of model was this, how did it work, what does it say 



**Back to the paper:**
- Methods
    - 1179 instructors participating in 4-day summer program from 2004 to 2014 
    - 750 respondents, 661 met the variables, 620 in final sample 
    - They took a survey
    - "We  asked  the  respondents  to  consider  seven  active-learning practices..."
        - Rated where they are in the EPIC-Implementation process on each
    - Also completed a measure of implicit theories of intelligence (Likert scale items aligned with Dweck mindset concepts) 
- Results
    - "instructors  who  held  the  belief  that  intelligence  is fixed—that  is,  that  students  either  “have  it”  or  they  don’t— reported  being  less  persuaded  that  active-learning  practices  are a  good  idea
    - Those with more fixed mindset reported fewer implementations compared with those with growth mindset
