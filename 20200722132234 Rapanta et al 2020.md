+ "Instructional presence" is the mix of roles that teachers take on as part-time instructional designer as well as being the person who enacts those instructional designs. Sounds like "mindful pedagogy"
+ Experts selected for interviews for this article had to have "Research expertise" (in what?),  10+ years of experience teaching online, and familiarity with different national educational systems. Seems like a strange mix of requirements. Why?
+ Focus on presence reminds me of [[20200716132518]] Kim et al 2014, [[20200709133057]] Kim et al 2014, [[20200708132153]] Muilenburg Berge 2005, and [[20200707135907]] Martin et al 2019 – it's a big deal, students see it as central and so do "award winning instructors" – what is it exactly?
