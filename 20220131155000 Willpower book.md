Does it take more willpower to do something small than it does to do something large  
  
Ego depletion probably explains a lot about where we are in higher education now  
  
Don't make your classes about willpower  
  
Four categories for uses of willpower  
1\. Control of thoughts  
2\. Control of emotions  
3\. Control of impulses (actually control of the reactions to impulses)  
4\. Control of performance  
  
Focus on one project at a time to avoid ego depletion - so perhaps not tracking several habits through the month but just one or maybe two  
  
Glucose plays a big role in self-control. Switch to a diet not unlike the Mediterranean diet with a lot of nuts cheese meats fish good fat  
  
Set clear goals but also ask:  
Do any of my goals conflict with each other?  
  
Proximal vs. Distal goals - proximal builds confidence and self regulation in children, distal works better for older kids , seeing a connection between what you're doing now and your distant goals is the best of all  
  
Decision making depletes willpower
