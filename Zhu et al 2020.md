>Zhu, X., Chen, B., Avadhanam, R., Shui, H., & Zhang, R. (2020). Reading and Connecting: Using Social Annotation in Online Classes. https://edarxiv.org/2nmxp/ 

+ This is a literature review of the use of social annotation in various forms of online instruction 
+ They did a search that brought back 249 results, filtered down to 39 after applying exclusion criteria 
+ After coding there were five main positive uses of social annotation: 
  + Helping to process domain-specific knowledge
  + Helping to support argumentation and inquiry
  + Improving literacy skills -- they mention ESL skills but could also apply to technical literacy 
  + Provides another avenue for instructor feedback
  + Brings together different parts of a learner's "learning ecosystem" if they are bringing various social networks and tools with them (example being spillover of "annotation flashmob" to Twitter)
+ The usual caveats apply: 
  + Make sure your learning objectives are clearly stated and that the tool/activities align with the learning objectives 
  + Determine in advance how involved the instructor is going to be
  + Determine in advance how annotation is going to be evaluated/assessed
+ Seems like this could be a good idea for mixing things up in pre-class activities for flipped and online classes 
+ But I wonder about tool overload -- "too many websites"
