>Henriksen, M., Kotas, J., & Wentworth, M. (2020). Specifications-based grading reduces anxiety for students of ordinary differential equations. CODEE Journal, 13(1), 1.

## Questions and focus 

- Main question: What effect does SBG have on student anxiety in math classes? 
- **Elsinger/Lewis**: Qualitative comments amongst SBG students indicate lowered anxiety, but there was no quantitative study
- **Lewis:** SBG resulted in lower self-reported anxiety, but [State-Trait Anxiety Inventory](https://www.apa.org/pi/about/publications/caregivers/practice-settings/assessment/tools/trait-state) showed *increased* anxiety – involved in-office reassessments 
- Focus:
    - Two universities, University of Portland and Wentworth Institute of Technology – both private
    - In a DE's class; mostly engineers
    - Portland: 
        - One section with 20 students for experiment vs. two sections (taught by other instructors) for control; grade came from 20% homework and 80% demonstrated proficiency on 26 specifications/standards
        - Four opportunities to demonstrate proficiency, three 85-minute in class assessments plus a 120-minute final exam period 
        - 11 specs were attemptable on the first assessment, then 21, then all 26 on third and fourth 
        - Problems were all of similar type and difficulty
        - Specs written with 4-point rubric 
    - WIT: 
        - SBG in four sections of ODEs (26,26,26,25 students); one section with 19 students for control 
        - Course grade done with two factors: Baseline grade determined by number of specs passed, and final exam (common cumulative final for all ODE sections) 
        - 6 fundamental theorems and concepts + 25 specs closely tied to learning outcomes 
        - Specs assessed in 9 separate assessments done in class, each graded pass/in progress/not yet passed 
        - Opportunities given to reassess outside of class – up to three retakes per spec (so four opportunities total) 




## Methods 

- Students given a survey at different times in the course to measure test anxiety level and other attributes (motivation to succeed, ability to manage time) 
    - "Rank the (amount of amxiety/motivation you feel to succeed on exams/time management skills in preparing for exams)  compared to other math classes you have taken or are currently taking" 
    - Much more/a little more/ about the same/ less/much less
- Survey was given four times in SBG classes (weeks 4,5,12,14 in a 14-week course at Portland; weeks 2, 4, 10, 13 in 15-week course at WIT); first and second surveys given just before first and second assessments 
- Control sections given the survey twice (before first exam + at the end) (**Why not four times also?**)

## Findings 

- Over time, anxiety levels diverged with control trending higher, SBG trending lower (**Graphs given but I don't see the numerical data**) 
- **No mention whether the differences are statistically significant;** but the final anxiety means are about 2.2 for SBG and 3.2 for control 
- Motivation and Time Management were roughly the same over time, although control was slightly higher than SBG in the end on each 
- Student comments: 
    - Anxiety in SBG classes were the result of the difficulty of the material, not the exam setup
    - "Vast majority" of students felt anxiety because of limited number of retakes remaining at the end 
- Grade results 
    - Students improve performance on individual specs over time generally speaking but with diminishing returns 
    - No comparison with control pass rates on similar topics
- Course grades 
-
