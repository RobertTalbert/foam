## Background info

- **Big question:** How might we get more university instructors to adopt active learning practices in their teaching? And, what's preventing people from doing so now? 
- **Summary of the background:** Adoption of any innovation in teaching can be modeled by five stages (the EPIC-Implementation model)
  - Exposure: Faculty first have to be clearly exposed to the thing. 
  - Persuaion: They then have to be persuaded that the thing is a good idea. 
  - Identification: They then have to be convinced in their own minds that the idea is doable for them. 
  - Commitment: They must then engage in "preaction" to commit to doing the thing. 
  - Implementation: Then they do the thing, engage in feedback loops and improve over time. 
  - All of this can be mitigated by faculty attitudes -- in particular, faculty beliefs about intellignce -- fixed versus growth -- can impede adoption of active learning. AL is predicated on the idea that students can improve knowledge with practice; if you don't really believe this, then you are less likely to be persuaded that AL is a good use of time. 
- **Specific questions:** Do faculty beliefs about fixed/growth mindsets have a significant effect on any of the stages of adoption? Particularly persuasion? 


## Responses

- I wonder how a study like this might work re: alternative grading -- to what extent do instructor beliefs about intelligence affect adoption of grading practices? 
- Does this EPIC-Implementation model apply to grading practices too? Or just in-class pedagogy?
