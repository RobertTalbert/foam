## Skim notes 

- Analysis done on an online corporate training course. So YMMV with validity to active learning in higher ed. 
- "seven principles for good practice in undergraduate education: (1) encourages contacts between students and faculty, (2) develops reciprocity and cooperation among students, (3) uses active learning techniques, (4) gives prompt feedback, (5)emphasizes time on task , (6) communicates high expectations, and(7) has respect for diverse talents and ways of learning."
- Gagne's nine events of instruction
    - 1.Gaining attention (reception) 
    - 2.Informing learners of the objective (expectancy) 
    - 3.Stimulating recall of prior learning (retrieval) 
    - 4.Presenting the stimulus (selective perception) 
    - 5.Providing learning guidance (semantic encoding) 
    - 6.Eliciting performance (responding) 
    - 7.Providing feedback (reinforcement) 
    - 8.Assessing performance (retrieval) 
    - 9.Enhancing retention and transfer (generalization) 
- "The Van Amburgh et al. (2007) study did not attempt to categorize or even articulate cognitive activity; rather, it measured active learning by the elapsed time observed for these 22 techniques." ‚Üê *important point* All the ALIT does is count events. But OTOH doesn't it also factor in the "risk"? 
- Researchers in the study took several online classes from a corporate training database and measured the percentage of time in each individual session that was spent on one of seven different active Learning categories and created this thing called an active learning index for each course which is essentially 100% minus the sum of those percentages.
