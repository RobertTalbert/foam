From Cal Newport, _So Good They Can't Ignore You_

+ Career capital is like monetary capital: 
    + You build it up through focused work 
    + You don't necessarily need to know what you'll eventually spend it on – just go ahead and start accumulating it anyway
    + You don't just sit on it, you reinvest it in other things to grow your wealth
    + You also invest it in other people and other pursuits that you find valuable
    + It buys you freedom, enjoyment, and security
+ Career capital = the development of rare and valuable skills. 
+ As a college professor, what are those skills and how do I develop them? 
+ As a _teacher_ how do I get better? 
    + What is the definition of "good" teaching? 
    + What are the benchmarks for knowing if your teaching is good, or the metrics for knowing if you're getting better? 
+ Some possible ways to get better as a teacher: 
    + Peer observation and feedback
    + Reading lots of books and articles about teaching
    + Practice with YouTube videos or Udemy courses – use YouTube to try out lessons and pedagogy
