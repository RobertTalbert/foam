+ Points to Strayer's thesis to point out that students felt a lack of structural support by which I think they mean human support. Another argument for social presence as seen in [[20200708132153]] and [[20200707135907]] Martin et al 2019. So flipped learning and online learning have that in common, that social support and connectedness make or break the experience. 
+ Revised Community of Inquiry (RCOI):
    + Cognitive presence
    + Social presence
    + Teaching presence
    + Learner presence 
+ All these RCOI presence forms seem to map onto the roles of online teachers as in [[20200707135907]] Martin et al 2019
